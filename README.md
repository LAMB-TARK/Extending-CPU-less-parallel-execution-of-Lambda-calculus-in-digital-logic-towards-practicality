# CPU-less parallel execution of lambda calculus in digital logic
This repository contains a demonstrational implementation of CPU-less parralel execution of lambda calulcus in digital logic consisting of a series of files.

1. logisim-evolution.jar 
2. LambdaCalculusV3.circ
3. Multiple TestBench.txt

This README document will show the steps required to simulate an example execution and read it's output. Note another LambdaCalculusV2.circ file exsists, certain lambda expressions will require its more advanced "NewNodeTracker" componenet to properly reduce, However it can be more intesive to simulate and is not required to execute the test benches provided. LambdaCalculusV2.circ can be found at [(https://github.com/LAMB-TARK/CPU-less-parallel-execution-of-Lambda-calculus-in-digital-logic)] but will be incapable of simulating advanced expressions nameley Lists and Arithmetic.
